## Approach Explanation
In this problem we need to plant the seedlings in such order, so that the party will be as early as possible. So we can store days for every seedlings to fully grow in an array & sort the array. Then traversing that sorted array we will find how many days it needs to throw the party. Here we need to remember it takes 1 day to plant one tree seedlings & the pary will happed after the day all the seedlings have grown up.

## Time Complexity Analysis
If we use Quick Sort algorithm to sort the array the time complexity will be O(nlog(n)) & again to traverse the whole sorted array time complexity will be O(n).
