# UAP Junior Programming Contest 2024 (1-1 to 2-2) - Editorial

## Navigation Walkthrough

- To access the editorials, navigate to the `Editorials` folder. Each problem has its dedicated file there.
- For the source codes, head to the `Source` folder. Inside, you'll find two folders: one for C and another for C++. Choose your preferred programming language. Within that folder, you'll find separate files for each problem's source code.
